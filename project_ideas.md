## Idea 1

## Food Spot Finder

## Focus: 
Finding great places to eat can be overwhelming especially for indecisive people. This web app would help users discover food spots based on mood, preferences, or unique experiences.

## 10 words or less:
Find food spots by mood, cuisine, and fun interactive features.

## Paragraph Idea:
Build a web application that helps users discover new food spots based on their mood, specific cravings, or even ambiance preferences (eg. cozy, romantic, lively). The app could even offer features like customizable food maps showing trending places as well as user reviews, ratings, and shareable food adventures to enhance community engagement.
