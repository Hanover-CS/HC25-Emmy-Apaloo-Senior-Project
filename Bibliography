# Food Spot Finder

### 1. Yelp (https://www.yelp.com)
  Features: Yelp is one of the largest platforms for finding restaurants and businesses, based on user-generated reviews, ratings, and photos. It includes filters for cuisine, price, location, and more.
  Pros: Large user base, comprehensive reviews, ratings, and local business partnerships.
  Cons: Over-reliance on user reviews can lead to biased or outdated information. Yelp's algorithm for ranking reviews has been criticized.
  Tech Stack: Built using Python, MySQL, and Apache Spark for data processing. ElasticSearch is used for searching reviews.

  Differentiation for your app: Focus more on mood and ambiance through interactive features like mood-based suggestions and AI recommendations rather than static reviews.

### 2. Zomato (https://www.zomato.com)
 Features: Formerly known as Urbanspoon, Zomato focuses on restaurant listings, user reviews, and features like photo-heavy menus.
 Pros: Extensive restaurant database with a global reach. Menu photos are particularly useful for smaller businesses without updated websites.
 Cons: Smaller user base compared to Yelp. Limited to certain regions, with fewer interactive features.
 Tech Stack: Primarily uses Python, Flask for backend, and PostgreSQL as the database.
  
Differentiation: You could incorporate real-time data like live ambiance reviews and interactive options based on real-time user preferences (e.g., quiet spots, energetic environments).
